[Gerrit](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/) is a great code review tool based on git and written by Google.
This library is an exporter to get transfer data from Gerrit into a RDBMS.
What is it good for? E.g. to create some analysis.

*ATTENTION*: This project is highly under development and can be completely change during development. But contribution is already welcome :)

## ToDos

Oh dear, there is so much todo.
E.g. write some unit tests, test this on some more gerrit server, make the HTTP DataService useable, etc.
If i got some more time i will create a list of tasks.
