In this area we will describe some ways in the next sections.

Talk about Gerrie
===================
As every other product / service word-of-mouth advertising is important.

You can talk about it in thousand ways:

* Presentation at conferences
* Presentation at usergroups
* Write a blog post
* Write a post on a mailing list
* Mention it in academic researches / papers
* Chat with a friend or colleague during a beer
* you will find a way

If you talk about Gerrie in a public way we would **love** to hear about this activity.
Would you be so nice to drop us a mail or a `ticket / issue`_ ?
Thank you!

Sponsoring
============
If you think "Hey, Gerrie is a cool and useful project. It helps me, my team or my company a lot" it would be nice if you think about to contribute back with a small sponsorship.
If we are talking about a sponsorship there are several different ways as well:

* **Financial**: You can sponsor money back to us e.g. to take a bill of a pizza, a beer or for a new feature.
* **Developer**: If you got a team of developer (e.g. you are an agency / company owner) we would love to see new contributer who will fix a bug or add a new feature.
* **Designer**: This is quite the same as for Developer, but for designer. Especially now, because we are :doc:`looking for a logo</contributing/logo>`
