Logo
#####

Every product needs a logo.
Even Gerrie.
Sadly the current authors are not very good in designing a meaningful logo.
This is the reason why we hope that a designer got some time to create a new shiny logo :)

This logo can be used to :doc:`talk about it at conferences or usergroups</contributing/various>` or to create a recognition value.

We don`t get a special briefing.
The designer got free space to design it.
In short what we are doing:

    A crawler for Googles code review system "Gerrit".

    Gerrie uses standardized API (like SSH or REST) offered by Gerrit to transform the complex data structure from Gerrit into a relational database like MySQL.

`gerrit`_, the open source project got already a logo: Diffy - The Kung Fu Review Cuckoo

Feel free.
We would like to receive a nice suggestion from you.
Sadly we do not get a budget for it, because we do not earn money with Gerrie.
Everything what we can offer is fame.
You will be mentioned everywhere we will publish this logo.
