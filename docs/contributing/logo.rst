Logo
#####

Every product needs a logo.
Even Gerrie.
Sadly the current authors are not very good in designing a meaningful logo.
This is the reason why we hope that a designer got some time to create a new shiny logo :)

This logo can be used to :doc:`talk about it at conferences or usergroups</contributing/various>` or to create a recognition value.
It will be displayed on every site where Gerrie is announced.

We don`t get a special briefing.
But here are some small words.
Maybe they help to develop an idea:

    Gerrie is a data mining tool / crawler to retrieve data from Googles code review system "Gerrit".
    Data mining is a more general word about retrieving, cleaning and analyze data to get new information out of it.
    The data which is mind is related to developer who spend (mostly) spare time to improve a software system by fixing bugs or adding new features.
    The data contains source code, comments, up and down votes.
    The data is retrieved by standarized interfaces which are provided by Gerrit.
    During this process the data will be transformed in a different format and stored in a database.

    The word "mining" can be lead to mining in general like coal mining.
    The author was born in Duisburg, Germany.
    Duisburg, Germany is a city which lived a long long time by mining.
    Many coal mines are around Duisburg.

The designer got free space to design it, but it would be nice to be a little bit related to such kind of story.

`gerrit`_, the open source project got already a logo: Diffy - The Kung Fu Review Cuckoo

Feel free.
We would like to receive a nice suggestion from you.
Sadly we do not get a (big) budget for it, because we do not earn money with Gerrie.
Everything what we can offer is fame.
You will be mentioned everywhere we will publish this logo.
